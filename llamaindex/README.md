## Project Title:
Unchanged.

## Description:
Unchanged.

## Docker Image:
This Docker image offers a meticulously crafted environment tailored for machine learning, natural language processing, and data science workflows, with a robust foundation for integrating both Python and Ruby-based tools. Here's an updated breakdown:

- **Base Image:** A customized Jupyter/scipy-notebook image (Tag: f3079808ca8c or a designated version) encompassing essential foundational tools.
- **Customization:**
  - **System Updates & Prerequisites:** Installation of commonly employed development tools and libraries (e.g., git, gcc, build essentials, database clients) to facilitate a robust development environment.
  - **LLVM:** Inclusion of the LLVM compiler infrastructure (version 11) for enhanced compilation capabilities.
  - **Python 3.10.7:** Seamless integration of Python 3.10.7, directly copied from the official python:3.10-slim image, ensuring compatibility and reliability.
  - **Ruby 3.1.3:** Seamless integration of Ruby 3.1.3, directly copied from the official rubylang/ruby image, ensuring compatibility and reliability.
- **User & Permissions Setup:** Configuration ensures that the container's primary user possesses appropriate permissions, including sudo access, for efficient resource management.
- **Languages:** Python, Ruby
- **Frameworks/Libraries:**
  - **Python:**
    - spaCy: Natural language processing
    - txtai: Real-time text and code search
    - LangChain: Language model chaining
    - llama-index: Large language model indexing
    - IPython: Interactive Python shell
    - nbconvert: Convert notebooks to various formats
    - NumPy: Scientific computing
    - Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
    - Matplotlib: Data visualization
    - ...Include other items from requirements.txt
  - **Ruby:**
    - iruby: Interactive Ruby shell
    - pycall: Call Python code from Ruby
    - dotenv: Environment variable management
    - LangChainRB: Language model chaining for Ruby
    - ruby-openai: OpenAI API client
    - ...Include other items from Gemfile

## Installation:
### Prerequisites:
- Docker installed and operational

### Pull the Image:
```bash
docker pull <image_name>:<image_tag>
```
(Replace `<image_name>` and `<image_tag>` with the appropriate values.)

## Usage:
### Start the container:
```bash
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 <image_name>:<image_tag>
```
### Access Jupyter Notebook:
Navigate to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) in your web browser. You'll require the token provided in the container's output to log in.

### Example:
Provide a fundamental code example or a concise explanation illustrating a core use case in either Python or Ruby to demonstrate the image's capabilities.

## Additional Notes:
- **Key Changes:** This revised version of the image allows for seamless integration and utilization of both Python and Ruby within the Jupyter environment, expanding the possibilities for data science and machine learning workflows.
- **Ruby Integration:** Explore the Ruby gems listed in the Gemfile or incorporate your own to augment your workflow and extend functionalities.
- **Customization:** While the base image provides a solid foundation, it can be further customized to cater to project-specific dependencies and requirements, ensuring a tailored environment for your specific needs.

We hope this revised version of the Docker image empowers you to unlock the full potential of your data science and machine learning endeavors.
